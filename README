Project 1: Sakila Customer Model API


Installation:
This is a Python Flask web application that must be run locally. The python dependencies are listed in requirements.txt of this repository. Simply pip install flask, pymysql and dicttoxml.

The application is also dependent on a MySQl database being run concurrently. A file db_config_template is provided, please input the relevant info into that file and rename it as db_config. Doing so allows the application to access the database and it is required for the app to run.

We have provided a CDRSv2.sql file which, like its name suggests, governs the schema of our database. Please import this file by running mysql -u <username> -p database_name < CDRSv2.sql in your terminal. These values <username> and <database_name> are the ones that will be put into db_config.

Running the application:
After setting up navigate to the project folder. From there run "python app.py". This will start the application at the http://localhost:5000. Now you can browse various urls to query the API. We have provided a shell script that will perform a demonstration of the API. It will perform CRUD, demonstrate pagination, querying and variable content formats. A variety of curl commands are also provided with the repository and you can perform these yourself to do your own manipulations to the
database.

Thank you
